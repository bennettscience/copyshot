## Code screenshot you can copy later

Code screenshots are popular, especially in social media. This is a proof-of-concept toy project that allows you to enter a code snippet and get a screenshot. You're also given a base64-encoded URL string which can be shared. When someone visits the URL, the page decodes the querystring and appends plaintext at the bottom of the page for copying.

## Why

I was tired of typing stuff into my console to try it out. It would be easier to copy it.

## To do

[] Refactor the page layout
[] Run some checks on URL encode/decode
[] Restyle the editor (bad colors right now)
